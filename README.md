##Shamir's Secret Sharing on the Ethereum blockchain

#Description:
Using Shamir's Secret Sharing to save a value, dividing it into 3 parts (shares) and encrypting those parts using multi signature (2-of-3) encryption. Afterwards the values are combined into one string which is then written onto the Ethereum blockchain. After retrieving the string from the blockchain, the value can be decrypted by entering 2 out of 3 private keys which were used to encrypt it originally.
